# Commands

Peak comes with an optional Paid addon containing a set of CLI commands to make tedious recurring tasks a lot easier. This addon requires an active license during development.

## Make Collection
This command creates a new collection and scaffolds out all needed files with some sane default markup containing the various Peak utilities we use.

Run `php please peak:make:collection` to:

* Create a collection in `content/collections/{handle}.yaml` with the variables you defined in the CLI.
* Create a blueprint for collection in `resources/blueprints/collections/pages/{handle}.yaml` containing the page builder fieldset and the SEO tab when your collection has a public route defined.
* Optionally create an index partial in `resources/views/{handle}/index.antlers.html` with default Peak markup.
* Optionally set the index template to the entry you chose to mount the collection on.
* Optionally create a show partial in `resources/views/{handle}/show.antlers.html` with default Peak markup.
* Optionally add permissions to the `editor` role in `resources/users/roles.yaml`.

## Make Page Builder Block
This command adds a block to the Peak Page Builder and generates the files needed.

Run `php please peak:make:block` to:

* Pick a group to add the block to.
* Add a set to the Page Builder replicator in `resources/fieldsets/page_builder.yaml`.
* Create a fieldset for your block in `resources/fieldsets/{filepath}/{filename}.yaml`.
* Create a partial with default markup and IDE hinting in `resources/views/page_builder/{filepath}/_{filename}.antlers.html`.

## Make Article (Bard) Set
This command adds a set to the Peak Page Builder Article (Bard) block and generates the files needed.

Run `php please peak:make:set` to:

* Pick a group to add the set to.
* Add a set to the Article Bard in `resources/fieldsets/article.yaml`.
* Create a fieldset for your set in `resources/fieldsets/{filepath}/{filename}.yaml`.

## Make Partial
With this command you can choose a type (component, layout, snippet or typography) and add a name and description. It will generate a partial with the proper IDE hinting and location comments.

Run `php please peak:make:partial`.

## Make Global
With this command you can generate a global with a blueprint and optionally grant edit permissions to the editor.

## Extending
You can register your own custom (private) content for `blocks`, `sets` and `presets`. This way you can install internal content onto your sites that should be private.

### Knowledge requirements
Behind the scene, the commands run a bunch of `operations`. The addon ships with the following built-in operations:

- `attach_collections_to_navigation`
- `attach_taxonomy_to_collections`
- `copy`
- `notify`
- `operation`
- `rename`
- `run`
- `update_article_sets`
- `update_page_builder`
- `update_role`

The built-in operations all live in the pre-registered `namespace` (`\Studio1902\PeakCommands\Operations`). 
In case you need more than the listed operations above, you can register your own namespace and build out your custom operations there.

When building your own operation, make sure to extend the `Studio1902\PeakCommands\Operations\Operation` class, which ensures your operation gets picked up correctly by the commands.

### Register custom content
To install your custom content, follow these steps:

1. Publish the config file by running: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=statamic-peak-commands-config`.
2. Add paths to the arrays for either `blocks`, `sets` or `presets`.
3. Make sure each block, set or preset is contained within a folder and contains a `config.php` using the following pattern (note, you can specify `type` as snake-cased or fully qualified class name).

```php
return [
    'handle' => 'pricing',
    'name' => 'Pricing tiers & features',
    'description' => 'Create and list pricing tiers and feature tables.',
    'operations' => [
        // Adds the ability to rename a collection handle. Use `{{ handle }}` in your files.
        [
            'type' => 'rename',
        ],
        // Runs a custom CLI command.
        [
            'type' => 'run',
            'command' => 'composer require vendor/package',
            'processing_message' => 'Installing vendor/package',
            'success_message' => 'Package installed.'
        ],
        // Copy a file, optionally add the option to skip the operation.
        [
            'type' => 'copy',
            'input' => 'source.file',
            'output' => 'destination.file',
            'skippable' => false // Default.
        ],
        // Update the page builder with a new block.
        [
            'type' => 'update_page_builder',
            'block' => [
                'name' => 'Title',
                'instructions' => 'Instructions',
                'icon' => 'icon',
                'handle' => 'handle',
            ]
        ],
        // Update Bard with a new set.
        [
            'type' => 'update_article_sets',
            'block' => [
                'name' => 'Title',
                'instructions' => 'Instructions',
                'icon' => 'icon',
                'handle' => 'handle',
            ]
        ],
        // Add permissions to a role. Use `{{ handle }}` when working with a renamable collection.
        [
            'type' => 'update_role',
            'role' => 'role_handle',
            'permissions' => ['view {{ handle }} entries', 'edit {{ handle }} entries', 'create {{ handle }} entries', 'delete {{ handle }} entries', 'publish {{ handle }} entries', 'reorder {{ handle }} entries', 'edit other authors {{ handle }} entries', 'publish other authors {{ handle }} entries', 'delete other authors {{ handle }} entries']
        ],
        // Attach collections to navigation.
        [
            'type' => 'attach_collections_to_navigation',
            'navigation' => 'handle',
            'collections' => ['collection_handle_1', 'collection_handle_2']
        ],
        // Attach taxonomy to collections.
        [
            'type' => 'attach_taxonomy_to_collections',
            'taxonomy' => 'handle',
            'collections' => ['collection_handle_1', 'collection_handle_2']
        ],
        // Notify the user with a message in the CLI. The user has to hit enter to continue.
        [
            'type' => 'notify',
            'content' => "All done."
        ],
    ]
];
```

### Programmatic configuration
In some scenarios, publishing the addon config might feel wrong. For example, you want to build your own suite of custom blocks, presets and sets and want to distribute those via an internal addon. 
Additionally, you need to ship some custom operations that are used in one of your presets. In that case you can configure the commands addon with the `Registry` facade.

The available methods are:
- `Registry::getPaths()`
- `Registry::addPresetsPath(string $path)`
- `Registry::addBlocksPath(string $path)`
- `Registry::addSetsPath(string $path)`
- `Registry::removePresetsPath(string $path)`
- `Registry::removeBlocksPath(string $path)`
- `Registry::removeSetsPath(string $path)`
- `Registry::getNamespaces()`
- `Registry::appendNamespace(string $namespace)`
- `Registry::prependNamespace(string $namespace)`
- `Registry::removeNamespace(string $namespace)`
- `Registry::resolveOperation(string $class, array $config)`

As an example, you add this to your addons `ServiceProvider`:
```php
use \Studio1902\PeakCommands\Facades\Registry;

public fuction bootAddon(){
    // Registers the namespace for your own operations
    Registry::prependNamespace('\Acme\YourAddon\Operations');
    
    // Registers a path for your own presets
    Registry::addPresetsPath(base_path('vendor/acme/your_addon/resources/presets'));
}
```
